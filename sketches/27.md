### The illusion of choice
Design prompt: interactive fiction Art prompt: "I always thought it was just an urban myth!" Oblique strategies: Is it finished? Random Shakespeare: Let me sit heavy on thy soul tomorrow! â€” from Richard III Random Emojis: ðŸŒ¼ ðŸ’·   RCers: June Pratt, Barry Van Tassell ---- We created some interactive fiction using a series of ChatGPT-generated adventure prompts. The user is given choices at each step but the choices have no impact.  There is almost no input filtering, so malformed input will likely result in Exceptions.  ![image](https://github.com/ukd1/rc-creative-coding/assets/955581/c96be8d6-e16d-489f-bedf-dc52533433d8)  [Haskell source code and prompt file](https://gist.github.com/YakBarber/d5ae2b904be8b9b5b37da191fbcd0bb5)
